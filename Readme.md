ENGLISH VISITORS PLEASE NOTE:

This repository formerly contained a modification to solve the Shipping Adress issues in the PayPal Express module integrated in Zen Cart as described here: 
https://www.zen-cart.com/showthread.php?186414-Paypal-Express-Checkout-Shipping-Address-Issue
As this issue is now resolved in the German Zen Cart version this old modification has been removed.
And the old modification breaks PayPal seller protection.

If you still want to use the old fix in your American Zen Cart version you can download it here:

PLEASE NOTE:
YOU ARE LOSING PAYPAL SELLER PROTECTION BY APPLYING THIS OLD FIX!
NO WARRANTY, NO RESPONSIBILITY, NO SUPPORT
USE AT OWN RISK

I was just tired of waiting for a solution for the American Zen Cart Version.
This issue gets ignored for so many years now
If you are still suffering from this issue in the American Zen Cart version and do not want to apply a fix that is killing seller protection describe your issue in detail in the following support thread:

Good luck...
